The Meal App - Approach

starting with project:
•	Create a new folder for the project and create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files inside it.
•	Link the CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file using the <link> and <script> tags.
•	Create a layout for the home page, meal detail page, and my favorite meals page using HTML and CSS.
Retrieve data from TheMeal API:
•	Use JavaScript's function to retrieve meal data from TheMeal API.
•	Use the data to dynamically generate the search results on the home page.
•	Add event listeners to the search bar to retrieve search results as the user types.
•	Implement favorite meals functionality:
•	Create a "favorites" array to store the user's favorite meals.
•	Add an event listener to the favorite button on each search result, which adds the meal to the "favorites" array when clicked.
•	Save the "favorites" array to local storage to make it persistent.
Create meal detail page:
•	Add an event listener to each search result that opens a new page with more information about that meal.
•	Retrieve the meal data from the API using the meal ID.
•	Display the meal data on the meal detail page.
Create my favorite meals page:
•	Retrieve the "favorites" array from local storage to display the user's favorite meals.
•	Add a remove button to each favorite meal, which removes the meal from the "favorites" array and updates the my favorite meals page accordingly.
•	Save the updated "favorites" array to local storage to make it persistent.
